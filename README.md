# FALFA OS (FULLY AUTOMATED LINUX FOR ALL)

This is an Arch-based Linux distribution designed to provide assisted help and video calling services, primarily aimed at elderly people.

- **Video Looping**: It loops a video or a sequence of videos provided, locking the keyboard and mouse to prevent misuse.

- **Skype Integration**: If a Skype account is entered at the first startup, calls can be made to the device on which it is installed. These calls are answered automatically, and the device’s camera is also activated if it has one. When the person on the other end hangs up, the call disappears from the screen and the video continues without user intervention.

- **Simple Setup**: The person who installs it will need to perform a simple setup and installation the first time to add the videos to be played and the Skype account, but from then on, all that’s needed is to press the power button to perform the mentioned function.
